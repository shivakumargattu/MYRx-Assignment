Given a sorted array of positive and negative numbers. You have to Square it and sort it. Constraint : Time complexity O(n) 
Example: 
Input: [-12, -8 , -7, -5, 2, 4, 5, 11, 15] 
Output : [4, 16, 25, 25, 49, 56, 121, 144, 225] 
2. Design an immutable class with following attributes 
String name; 
String Id, 
Date dateOfJoining 
List<Address> addresses; 
3. Given an array of Red Green Blue balls.You have to sort it. 
Constraint : Time complexity O(n) 
Constraint : Space complexity O(1) 
Example: 
Input: [R, G, B, G, G, R, B, B, G] 
Output : [B,B,B,G,G,G,G,R, R] 
4. We are given two arrays that represent the arrival and departure times of trains, the task is to find the minimum number of platforms required so that no train waits. 
Examples: 
Input: arr[] = {9:00, 9:40, 9:50, 11:00, 15:00, 18:00}, dep[] = {9:10, 12:00, 11:20, 11:30, 19:00, 20:00} 
Output: 3 
Explanation: There are at-most three trains at a time (time between 9:40 to 12:00) 
Input: arr[] = {9:00, 9:40}, dep[] = {9:10, 12:00} 
Output: 1 
Explanation: Only one platform is needed. 
5. Sort hashmap by value. 
Example: 
Input: Map: {101=John Doe, 102=Jane Smith, 103=Peter Johnson} 
output: Map: {102=Jane Smith, 101=John Doe, 103=Peter Johnson}
